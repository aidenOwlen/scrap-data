######### SCRAP DATA BOT ##########

Here is the work with .exe compiled file and the source code.

Language used : AutoIT

****First you open the program, if for some reason it doesn't work, run it as admin
1) You have the choice either to run it immediatly or to add dates with hours and minutes : In the FIRST CASE, you select RunNow, click "START" then program will start collecting immediatly. In the SECOND CASE, you select the second option, specify exact days , hours and minutes when you want it to run ou click "START then the program will run in background and wait for the date to come to start collecting.

2) You can choose either to hide the program while collecting or let it visible PS: I RECOMMEND letting it visible, as you will be able to see the progress.

3) You can select either to download product's IMAGES or not.

4) FOR NOW : you can only see your "IP". If you want to be able to change it then we will need to have a TEAMVIEWER session and you'll need to have a VPN aswell ( I don't see why you'll need to change the IP, let me know if it's needed)

5) When you start collection : Data aswell as images ( if you select the download images option ) are stored into .txt files in DESTOP\ProjectH folder, or simply CLICK OPEN DATA to access it.

6) Dates you add are stored in DESKTOP\ProjectHTime.txt

7) Number of Data collected is stored in TEMPDIR\DateProjectH\Dates BUT you can see it directly : IN THE FIRST TAB : The number that show up in red is actually number of data collected during the last "START", IN THE DATE TAB it's actually number of data collecting during the day.
It scrap all data of the subcategory, page by page.

****PLEASE NOTE : 
Program works silently.

In the first tab make sure to enter only the category and subcategory without link for example
Category : Super
SubCategory : abarrotes

##IF THE SUBCATEGORY CONTAINS MORE THAN ONE WORD FOR EXAMPLE : http://www.heb.com.mx/super/carnes-y-pescados/pescados-y-mariscos.html : PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THAT CASE :
CATEGORY = super
SUBCATEGORY = carnes-y-pescados/pescados-y-mariscos

############ TEXT DATA IS STORED INTO .TXT FILES , YOU CAN IMPORT IT TO ANY DATABASE YOU WANT ############
